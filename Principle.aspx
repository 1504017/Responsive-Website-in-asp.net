                <h2>Principle</h2>
                <p>The world has changed enormously since The Doon School welcomed its first students in 1935, but its mission to attract and develop exceptional boys and teachers from all backgrounds to serve a meritocratic India remains as vital now as it was then. With scholarships and bursaries available to support almost half our students, we aim to reduce, as far as possible, any financial barriers to admission.</p>
<p>At The Doon School we take our responsibility to find what is exceptional in boys very seriously. The experience that we have prepared for them here gives every boy an all-round education built on a foundation of Service, Adventure, Sports, Creative Arts and Academics.</p>
<p>As a fully residential school we also nurture a commitment to compassion, respect and well being that we believe is an antidote to the entitlement, anxiety and lack of connection that dominate the day-to-day lives of so many teenagers.</p>
<p>Our experienced and dedicated teachers live, work and play with our boys in the beautiful Chandbagh estate and in the region around Dehradun. We also take advantage of the opportunities that our memberships of organisations like the Round Square, International Award and the International Baccalaureate offer for international exposure and travel through exchanges and study trips.</p>
<p>To prepare boys to enter a competitive and interconnected world we build their capacity to collaborate, take intellectual risks and turn their ideas and passions into something original and valuable. We want them to leave The Doon School ready to engage with and contribute to any team they find themselves a member of; life is a team sport after all.</p>
<p>For many years our boys have achieved significantly above national and international averages for ICSE, ISC and IB results and have been offered places at some of India’s and the world’s most interesting and selective universities. With the support of our Old Boys we also have an enviable reach into internships and work placements that help to shape both aspiration and opportunity.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more about The Doon School or would like to arrange a visit to see what we do to transform boys into educated men; inspire them to be just and ethical citizens; train them to be wise and principled leaders and prepare them to enter one of the strongest fraternities for life, then please visit our admissions page.</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting you.</p>
<p>Matthew Raggett</p>
